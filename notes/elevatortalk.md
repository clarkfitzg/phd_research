How do I describe my research in 30 seconds? What are the big questions to
answer?

Can a system take an arbitrary piece of data analysis code and adapt it to
the data and platform? The idea is to take a simple, possibly naive
implementation of a data analysis program in the R language and transform
it to something that runs reasonably efficiently.
