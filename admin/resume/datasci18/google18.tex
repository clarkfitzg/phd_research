\opening{Dear Dr. Akintunde,}

I would like to join the TREK because I am considering a career
at Google after I complete my PhD in statistics. Several of my classmates have
joined Google as quantitative analysts, but I'm more interested in the
software engineering role.

I would also like to connect with other students at UC Davis with similar
    interests.

In 2012 I first learned about data science, and I have vigorously pursued
it since then.

My research focuses on the R language for statistical data analysis. I
develop methods to automatically scale R code to larger data sets.

Stephan Hoyer, my former supervisor at Climate Corporation,
currently works as a Software Engineer at Google Research.

This visit seems like an excellent way for me to learn what it's like to be a
software engineer.


\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
