Dear Kayla August,

<!--
Intro, state basics, show excitement

My name is Richard Clark Fitzgerald, and I'm a PhD Candidate in Statistics at UC Davis.
I'm applying for the position of Statistician (Data Scientist) at the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA).
This job appeals to me for two reasons.
First, I believe in the mission of serving veterans.
I'm an Army veteran of Afghanistan, and I have worked and volunteered with veterans for the last 10 years.
Second, the VHA has the nation's largest health care system, which must generate rich and interesting data sets.
As a data scientist, I'm excited about opportunities to improve policy and health care through data analysis.

More about me

I am qualified for this job based on a combination of 2 years of specialized experience and education (masters in statistics).
Since 2012 I've been either working in data science, or studying data science full time.

What I can uniquely bring to the job
-->
I see this job as an opportunity to make a strong local connection between the VHA and the UC Davis Data Science Initiative (DSI).
The DSI draws experts together from across domains to innovate and learn using data science; it's the regional leader for data science in the Sacramento area.
I have been involved with the DSI since its inception in 2014.
I'm here every day, I've initiated and organized study groups, and I've designed and delivered workshops on technical topics like R, Python, and SQL.
This active participation has given me a broad network of contacts beyond my department, from computer science to the UC Davis Medical Center.
My network could help spark collaboration with the VHA and world class UC Davis researchers.

As a PhD candidate in statistics and data science at UC Davis my research has focused on addressing the inherent computational challenges.
Solving them requires analytical and computational skills, both of which I have.

I have not yet worked extensively with healthcare data, but I can learn.
I knew nothing about fashion or women's clothing when I started consulting last January for Lulu's fashion boutique, an online retailer.
But within two weeks I learned about their data, produced practical predictive models for when items would be returned, identified actionable patterns in sizing affecting tens of thousands of customers, and presented the results clearly to the CEO and company executives.
Indeed, one reason I chose data science as a profession is that I enjoy learning about new domains and new kinds of data.

For the last 10 years I've gone out of my way to work with veterans.
After I was honorably discharged from the Army in 2008 I led OEF/OIF combat veterans on mountain expeditions with Outward Bound Wilderness to assist in transitioning from war to civilian life.
While studying mathematics at UC Berkeley I organized events for hundreds as an officer of the vibrant Cal Veterans Group.
As a budding data scientist at Cisco Systems I was an active member of the veterans organization.
As a  I volunteer regularly as a tutor for student veterans at the newly opened Veterans Success Center.
I care about serving veterans, which is why I would like to work for the VA.

Sincerely,
Richard Clark Fitzgerald
