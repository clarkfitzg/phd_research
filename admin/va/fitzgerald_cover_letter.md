Cover Letter for Data scientist job at Veterans Administration (VA)

Possible points to convey:

- I've been working and volunteering with veterans for last 10 years
- Can do the full data science stack: questions, math models, implementation, communication
- Leadership and initiative
- (Not sure?) I haven't worked with healthcare data- could turn it around and say I've worked with all these other types of data.


Dear Kayla August,

For the last 10 years I've gone out of my way to work with veterans.
After I was honorably discharged from the Army in 2008 I lead OEF/OIF combat veterans on mountain expeditions with Outward Bound Wilderness to assist in transitioning from war to civilian life.
While studying mathematics at UC Berkeley I organized events for hundreds as an officer of the vibrant Cal Veterans Group.
As a budding data scientist at Cisco Systems I was an active member of the veterans organization.
As a PhD candidate in statistics and data science at UC Davis I volunteer regularly as a tutor for student veterans at the newly opened Veterans Success Center.
I believe in the mission of the VA, and I'm uniquely qualified for this position.

I have not yet worked extensively with healthcare data, but I can learn.
In January I worked as a consultant for Lulu's fashion boutique, an online retailer.
At first I knew nothing about fashion or women's clothing.
But within two weeks I learned about their data, produced practical predictive models for when items would be returned, identified actionable patterns in sizing affecting tens of thousands of customers, and presented the results clearly to the CEO and company executives.
As a data scientist I'm comfortable with 

Sincerely,
Richard Clark Fitzgerald
