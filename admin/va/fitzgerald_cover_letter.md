Dear Kayla August,

<!--
Intro, state basics, show excitement
-->
My name is Richard Clark Fitzgerald, and I'm a 5th year PhD Candidate in Statistics at UC Davis.
I'm applying for the position of Statistician (Data Scientist) at the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA).
This job appeals to me for two reasons.
First, I believe in the mission of serving veterans.
I'm an Afghanistan veteran, and I have worked and volunteered with veterans for the last 10 years.
Second, the VHA has the nation's largest health care system, which must generate rich and interesting data sets.
As a data scientist, I'm excited about data driven opportunities to improve policy and health care.

<!--
More about me
-->
I am a strong candidate for this job based on a combination of education (masters in statistics), and 2 years of specialized work experience applying data science.
My PhD research focus is on scaling data analysis code to run faster on larger datasets.
This research could be valuable at the VHA.
For example, a researcher may write code that simulates the outpatient consultation system to better predict access to care.
One simulation may take 1 hour to run on a small laptop, but we need 1000 such simulations.
The software I've created in my research could directly modify this code so that it will run all 1000 simulations on a supercomputer in 5 hours.
This increases productivity and produces more timely results for the VHA.

In addition to my research experience I have broad expertise in statistics, machine learning, and computing.

<!--
What I can uniquely bring to the job

rework, focus on me, not DSI
-->
I see this job as an opportunity to make a strong local connection between the VHA and the UC Davis Data Science Initiative (DSI).
The DSI draws experts together from across domains to innovate and learn using data science; it's the regional leader for data science in the Sacramento area.
I have been involved with the DSI since its inception in 2014.
I'm here every day, I've initiated and organized study groups, and I've designed and delivered workshops on technical topics like R, Python, and SQL.
This active participation has given me a broad network of contacts beyond my department, from computer science to the UC Davis Medical Center.
My network could help spark collaboration with the VHA and world class UC Davis researchers.
