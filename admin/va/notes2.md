Experience must demonstrate the following: expert knowledge and mastery in applying a wide range of advanced computational methods in simulation (i.e., agent based modelling), statistics (logistic regression, multinomial regression, survival analysis ), machine learning (random forest, SVM, neural networks), feature extraction/feature engineering, data transformation specifically in their application in healthcare operation/healthcare research and advanced data visualization (i.e., web/interactive visualization).
In addition the application must demonstrate the ability to learn and master new unfamiliar computational methods with minimal instruction or oversight; show expert knowledge in an upper level programing language the like of Python, Matlab, Java, R in ability to manipulating data for the sake of data filtering, statistical & machine learning modeling, model selection, model validation and data visualization; development on PC and/ or Linux/Unix; working knowledge in using SQL language; Python notebooks to generate complex publication ready material and academic press be in in print and/or on the web; and working knowledge in MS-word, Latex, R markdown.
