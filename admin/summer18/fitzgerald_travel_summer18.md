__Abstract:__
On August 2nd I will present an invited talk at JSM in the section on
statistical computing organized by George Ostrouchov and Norm Matloff. The
title for the talk is __Automatic Parallelization of R Code__ and the
abstract is as follows:

> Conventional systems for parallel programming require users to modify
> existing serial code to take full advantage of a platform's computational
> capabilities. In this presentation we consider methods to automatically
> infer the potential for parallelism based on R language idioms and code
> structure. A system can then automatically transform the serial version of
> the code into equivalent new versions that offer improved performance. The
> parallelism could come from simple replacement of functions, or from more
> elaborate code rewriting, or even from mapping R code into a totally
> different technology.
