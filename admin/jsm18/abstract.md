Automatic Parallelization of R Code

Conventional systems for parallel programming require users to modify existing serial code to take full advantage of a platform's computational capabilities. In this presentation we consider automated code analysis methods to detect the potential for parallel execution in R code. A system can then automatically transform the serial version into an equivalent parallel version.  

We consider a motivating case study analyzing hundreds of gigabytes of California's highway traffic sensor data.
