### Intellectual Merit

In August 2018, I presented an invited paper at the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) in Vancouver, BC titled "Automated Parallelism in R Code".
This is the largest annual conference in statistics, with about 8,000 attendees.
Here's the abstract:

> Parallel programming lets us scale data analysis code to bigger data sets and larger problems.
> The current state of the art requires the user to modify their code, sometimes extensively, to make it run in parallel on a particular platform.
> We introduce a system that infers parallelism in R code, and then generates efficient parallel code tailored for a specific data set and platform.
> This allows us to adapt code to different parallel platforms, and enhance performance using techniques that would be impractical if done by hand.

I implemented my ideas in open source software through an R package, `makeParallel`.
I published this software on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), which means any R user can easily download and use it.


### Broader Impacts

This past year I have done more teaching.
I gave a technical presentation introducing web Application Programming Interfaces (API's) along with the Associate Director of the Data Management Program, Vessela Engsberg.
I co-developed and led two workshops on introductory databases and Structured Query Language (SQL) catered to undergraduate students in the business school.
Both students and staff from the University attended and found it very helpful.
In Winter 2019, I had my first opportunity to be an instructor of record when I taught Statistics 141C, Big Data and High Performance Computing, the final class in the upper division undergraduate statistical computing sequence.
I also served as a technical reviewer for a recently published book, A Computational Approach to Statistical Learning, by Arnold, Kane, and Lewis.
