During the last year I've volunteered as a tutor, seminar organizer, and
programming instructor. 2017 marked the opening of the new UC Davis
Veterans Success Center. I continue to work closely with the coordinator, Earl
Raehsler, as a weekly tutor in mathematics and statistics for fellow student
veterans. Last fall I took another turn as the organizer of the
statistics student seminar that a fellow student and I initiated in 2016.
We successfully transitioned the organizer role between students, and the
seminar is now in its 5th quarter.  In January 2018 I co-instructed a 2 day
Software Carpentry workshop catered towards graduate students in the life
sciences. Later in March I will attend a 2 day Software Carpentry
instructor training so that I can improve my skills in technical
communication.

The general theme of my research is to take computer code that analyzes
data, understand the code, and find ways to automatically make it more
efficient. In June 2017 I passed my PhD oral qualifying exam by presenting
a talk titled "Parallel Computing Through Code Analysis". I described a
motivating application to traffic engineering of a qualitatively new kind
of analysis that requires processing 3 billion data points. In the fall I completed this
analysis, demonstrating how to generate code to efficiently combine several
specific technologies. I'm currently focusing how to generalize the code
analysis techniques. Along the way I've learned much about parallel
computing and was able to contribute to an article "The R Language: A
Powerful Tool for Taming Big Data" which will be published in the
"Encyclopedia of Big Data Technologies" this year.

I've made my results available to a broader audience through software and a
blog. This past year I've written about both basic and research topics in
data intensive computing in 25 posts in my blog "Data Programming" which can be
found at http://clarkfitzg.github.io/. The techniques for parallelism
are available in the `autoparallel` package at
https://github.com/clarkfitzg/autoparallel.
