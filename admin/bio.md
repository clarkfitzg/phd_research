__Automated parallelism for data analysis__
Clark works on techniques and software to identify patterns in R code and
then uses these patterns to automate the generation of programs that scale
better to larger data sets. Automation, software engineering, and elegant
solutions make him happy. He has designed and led workshops at the DSI on
Python, SQL, web API's, and parallel programming. Clark would like to
connect with the larger data science community around Sacramento.
