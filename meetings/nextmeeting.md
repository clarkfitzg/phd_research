I've presented at JSM and gotten some feedback. Now I need to decide what
to do next. My goal is to complete my thesis by September 2019.

I could work on any of the following things:


## Thesis Chapter Outlines

Estimated effort: 3 days

I have written draft outlines for chapters. Now Duncan and I need to
discuss and edit it to make sure we're both happy. Then I need to run it by
the other committee members, probably Ethan and Norm.


## partools Paper with Norm and Robin

Estimated effort: 3 days

Norm and Robin are writing a paper on the partools package to submit to the
R Journal. I would write a short section on disk based sorting that I did
during the summer of 2017 and be the 3rd author.


## Conference Paper

Estimated effort: 4 days

The ASA will publish my talk from JSM in the conference journal, [JSM
Proceedings](http://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2018/submissions.cfm#proceedings).
The submission window is open from August 28 to September 29. This is
mostly a matter of editing my notes and thesis draft to fit it in a short
paper format.


## CodeAnalysis Paper

Estimated effort: 10+ days

- Dead code removal. This is based on the task graph
- Grouping plotting code


## Implement Fork Based Scheduling Algorithm

Estimated effort: 5+ days

I've written down the conceptual ideas for an automatic parallelization
algorithm based on fork and join. Next I need to implement and test it.


## makeParallel Improvements

Estimated effort: 1 - 20 days

makeParallel has a TODO file which includes the following: 

- Handle calls to `library()`.
- Move task graph computation fully into CodeAnalysis, and incorporate
  CodeAnalysis as a dependency for makeParallel.
- Plotting methods
- Easier interface to provide run times and object sizes


## Software Carpentry Instructor Certification

Estimated effort: < 0.5 day

I need to jump through a couple more hoops to become a certified
instructor. I've already done the bulk of the work.
