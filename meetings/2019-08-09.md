In the abstract, clarify what's in there, and what we'll do.

Err on the side of writing a user manual versus something that's excessively academic- i.e. don't try to make it look like a fancy CS paper.
The focus should be on the concepts.
We can add and generalize that kind of stuff later.

Do write chapter abstracts that say what are the claims, and a quick summary.
These may not go directly into the final product, but they will be useful for focusing.

Big questions:

- What's the class of problems that we are solving?
- What are the assumptions, where are we starting from?
    Specifcially, the vectorized example needs this.

Add more content with experiments and numerical times showing improvement.

We don't have to include everything.
Thesis is not a diary of everything you did in grad school.

Think carefully about what each section means, and why it's there.
Specifically, in each section:

- What's the purpose?
- What does it address?
- What are the conclusions?
- Why is it important?

Idea for incrementally growing a data example:

1. single files
2. multiple files
3. URL's
4. DBMS

We _need_ to be able to handle the cases where the data is not already split, and when the data description is in the code, i.e. starting from `x = read.csv("x.csv")$x1`.

It's fine and good to separate the external data dependency detection into a separate step, say to go in CodeAnalysis.


## Incremental example

Write the first chapter to provide motivation as a series of incrementally growing examples, meaning we just change one thing.
