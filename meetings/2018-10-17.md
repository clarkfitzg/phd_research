The whole point of my thesis is "here's how to choose between different ways of doing things" not "here's a new way of doing things".


TODO:

- More literature review for distributed systems.
  What academic research takes into account the size and nature of the data?
  What software projects do something with it? (Pig, dask, tensorflow, ...?)
  Send Duncan the relevant results
- Get the whole pipeline working for a couple different examples (data description, platform description, code analysis) rather than focusing too much on one part like scheduling.
