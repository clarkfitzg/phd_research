Duncan would like to see:

A function that infers information about the code.
It should take in a script, say `file.R`, perhaps a list of vectorized functions, and a list of files.
It should output all the possible ways to organize the data such that we can do the computation.

Given the code, data, and platform, here's what we need to do:

1. Collect / infer everything that influences how we might organize the computations and distribute the data among the workers.
2. Enumerate all the different strategies, and how long each one will take.
3. Rewrite / generate code that will use one of these strategies.

I've had difficulty expanding the code.
