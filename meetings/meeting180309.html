<p>Summary: Mapping R code on data frames into relational algebra will let us use powerful query optimization technqiues and push calculations into underlying data storage.</p>
<p>Thu Mar 8 08:58:56 PST 2018</p>
<p>Notes before meeting with Duncan tomorrow morning. Duncan expressed the concern that we have to be careful to distinguish between the work that Nick and I do for our theses. Nick’s already got “tools for R code analysis”, so I should be doing something higher level. Thus I need to specialize, ie. look at some particular types of programs. Ideally I can build on what he’s done.</p>
<h3 id="need-for-algebra">Need for Algebra</h3>
<p>I’ve been thinking about how to represent R code in a way that facilitates analysis and transformations.</p>
<p>Some points that we’ve agreed on before:</p>
<ul>
<li>R tends to be more high level and declaractive, rather than procedural.</li>
<li>A useful code analysis task is to standardize R code, ie. transform it into a canonical form.</li>
<li>Programmatically rewriting R code for performance is useful if we can be sure that the results will be the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>Duncan has shown that compilation is very helpful for accelerating procedural R code. I’m interested in working with the more declarative code, ie. manipulating data frames.</p>
<p>One difficulty with standardizing R code is that there are often several ways to express the same calculation. For example, we can write <code>head(x + 5)</code> or <code>head(x) + 5</code>. The latter is more efficient when <code>x</code> is large. We need a principled approach to infer that these two expressions are semantically equivalent. If we map these R expressions into a purely semantic representation then we can use algebraic rules to make valid transformations. We can potentially even use an existing query optimizer. Conversely, if we don’t use something robust like an algebra I fear that we’ll end up with a collection of ad hoc heuristics.</p>
<h3 id="integrating-data">Integrating data</h3>
<p>The exciting problems for me are when the data is enormous. The data often start stored in some underlying technology such as Hive, Cassandra, etc. These systems are highly engineered and often capable of performing some part of the computation on their own, ie. at least column selection and basic filters.</p>
<p>It’s foolish to try to reinvent these systems (Norm Matloff might disagree). I think the novelty and value lies in <strong>integration</strong>, ie. how can we take some big complex data storage and processing engine and combine it efficiently with R?</p>
<p>On a side note these true big data problems and systems seem to exist more in industry and less in academia, for many reasons.</p>
<h3 id="relevant-technology">Relevant technology</h3>
<p>My end goal has always been to take (code, data, platform) and come up with an efficient execution strategy. If this is going to happen then I need a cost model for run time and a data storage abstraction.</p>
<p>Many of these larger systems use the Java library <a href="https://calcite.apache.org/">Apache Calcite</a> internally. I could see using Calcite (or something like it) for query optimization and interfaces to data storage. Calcite has a rich set of query optimization rules, so we can start with those and then add any additional ones we have that are R specific. The adapters to specific data storage give us a nice abstraction that additionally allows pushing computation to the data.</p>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calcite is Java, and I don’t know Java.</li>
<li>It may be easier to just reimplement a poor version of Calcite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the specific API for building relational algebra expressions: https://calcite.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/calcite/tools/RelBuilder.html.</p>
<p>A side effect is that we would get a two way translator between R and SQL.</p>
