Refining goals for summer. Spoke to Duncan on Monday. We talked about
doing case studies on parallelism. I need to actually do the PeMS data
analysis on Hadoop / Spark, see how it works. Understand the operating
characteristics of the systems.

Specific goal #1: Implement PeMS analysis on Spark. Or possibly just
preprocessing.
