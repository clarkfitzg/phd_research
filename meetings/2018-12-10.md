TODO:

- Come up with examples of doing A -> B -> C that get big speedups
- Write example by hand and walk through thought process of how the software will work.
  When will it go parallel?
  How fast will each possible solution be relative to the serial version.
- Do an example that shows what happens when data is on the same disk.
- Walk through what happens in an example that requires cross file access, such as the PEMS example.
