Data on open source software projects. 6 GB, 200 million rows. Haven't yet
looked at it.

Veterans appeals decisions, looks like for medical disability claims.
https://www.index.va.gov/search/va/bva.jsp About 40,000 cases per year.
Each case is a text file. Text format looks reasonably consistent.
Goes back to 1993, total about 1 million cases. Entire data set could be
around 20-60 GB of plain text.
The few I looked at either grant or deny a disability rating.
I'd have to do some serious scraping to get them out.
