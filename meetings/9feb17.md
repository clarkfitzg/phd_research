Todo: Write a paper proposing topic for the QE. Cover as much as I can.
Consider it like a prospectus describing a plan for research. No specific
page requirement, but 25+ pages is fine. This will be something that will
evolve into a thesis. It should read somewhat like Duncan's Stat Sci paper.

Sections should include:
- background, literature review
- basic approaches
- Applications
    - Code visualization
    - Generation of code
    - Compilation for different systems

It's fine to change `CodeDepends` or even start from scratch.

Design a data structure that will hold the code in a suitable form for
analysis.

Look at code analysis / dev tools in other languages.

Goal: A live system that can figure out how to best run the computations.

Relative timings are more important than seconds.

Adapting code to the data is a big idea here. Ie. we may be able to combine
static analysis with actual information on `n` and `p` to develop more
efficient strategies. Then optimize runtime.

Along the way I can build out tools.
