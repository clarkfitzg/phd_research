Duncan and I were talking about the code analysis, which is something I
need to get on. I'd like to do this in a literate programming style.

## Optimization

Consider execution of code as an optimization problem. The semantics of the
language are the constraints. We want to perform the same calculations,
only faster.

Suppose we're deciding whether to execute `lapply(x, f)` in serial
or in parallel via `parallel::mclapply(x, f)`. To make this decision
generally we need to know several parameters based on the code running on
that system:

(Units are seconds and bytes)

```{R}

p = list()

# How long does it take to execute f(x[i])?
p$one_func_time = 1e-6

# How large is f(x[i])?
p$one_func_memory = 20

```

We also need to know something about that system:

```{R}

s = list()

# How long does it take to call mclapply with no args?
s$mclapply_overhead_time = 5e-3

# How quickly can one transfer data between processes?
s$transfer_rate = 400e6

```
