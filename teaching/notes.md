What makes for a good class?

### Class

Good

- Organization, it's clear what's being asked, and how I'm evaluated.
- Challenge, intellectual interest of the material.
- Timely feedback on assignments.
- Relates class to other things I know or will do in the future.

Bad

- In class student presentations that drag on forever.
- Assignments too easy or too hard.

### Instructor

Good

- Confident, clear speaking
- Write large and clear
- Address the whole classroom
- Sense of humor

Bad

- Arrogant
- Allow students to be disruptive
- Long tangents from class material
- Frets publicly about how behind the class is compared to where it should be
- Criticizes whole class when only small subset have a problem


I should give the TA some high level direction, also talk to him first about what he wants- long term career and short term.
