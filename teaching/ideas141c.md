## Concepts

__Chunking__
Data too big?
Cut it up into pieces that you can work with.
This can be parallel too.

__Map side join__
One big table larger than memory, one small table that fits in memory, do something that requires joining the two.


## Use cases

__Animal movements__
Given GPS tracking data of where the monkeys have moved, describe how they behave.
