A little EDA on the new fd data.

```{R}

load("fds.RData")

errors = sapply(fds, is, "try-error")

mean(errors)
length(fds)

```

Processed 3720 stations, and just over half resulted in errors.

I'll bind these together in a 3d array representing the low occupancy / free flowing traffic.

```{R}

fds = fds[!errors]

firstone = fds[[1]]

get_freeflow = function(x) as.vector(x[[2]]$low_occupancy)

freeflow = do.call(c, lapply(fds, get_freeflow))

freeflow = array(freeflow
    , dim = c(2, 3, length(fds))
    , dimnames = list(coefficient = c("intercept", "slope")
                    , type = c("estimate", "stderr", "tvalue")
                    , station = allfiles[!errors]
                    )
    )

freeflow[, , 1:2]

freeflow["slope", ]

```

Now for a little plotting.


```{R}

freeflow2 = freeflow[, , freeflow["slope", "stderr", ] < 0.1]

hist(freeflow2["slope", "estimate", ])

hist(freeflow2["slope", "stderr", ])

hist(freeflow2["intercept", "estimate", ])

hist(freeflow2["intercept", "stderr", ])

```

Filter out those with large standard errors- likely came from too few
observations.

Surprising that the slopes vary so much. Speed limits aren't that
different. Could it be caused by an excess of zeros?

Next: try clustering with kmeans or other.

Lets see if I can find the metadata. It shows up for each station page like
this:

```
Roadway Information (from TSN)
Road Width  48 ft
Lane Width  12.0 ft
Inner Shoulder Width    5 ft
Inner Shoulder Treated Width    2 ft
Outer Shoulder Width    10 ft
Outer Shoulder Treated Width    10 ft
Design Speed Limit  65 mph
Functional Class    Principal Arterial W/ C/L Prin Arterial
Inner Median Type   Ditch
Inner Median Width  99 ft
Terrain Flat
Population  Urbanized
Barrier Guardrail in Median Both Roadway
Surface Concrete
Roadway Use No Special Features
```


```{R}

library(rgdal)

s1 = rgdal::readOGR("/home/clark/data/pems/shn2016")

s2 = rgdal::readOGR("/home/clark/data/pems/shn2016")

```
