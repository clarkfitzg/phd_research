# Propagate Resources
#

#
# This is a proof of concept to determine if the code calls `by`, where the argument to split the data on is known.
#
# The approach is to first propagate through the special semantic meanings of the code that we care about.
# It works by iterating over the code, method dispatch on the class of the nodes, and updating mutable data structures as it infers things.
# rstatic made it all much easier than it would have been otherwise.
#
# Many nodes may refer to the same resource.
# There are three data structures involved:
#
# - ast The propagation step assigns each node a resource ID.
# - name_resource is an environment where the keys are variable names in the code and the values are resource ID's.
# - resources is an environment where the keys are resource ID's and the values are 

library(rstatic)

# Returns the name of the added resource

    # All based on side effects
    assign(new_name, value = r, pos = resources)
    resource_id(node) = new_name

    new_name
}


# Propagate resource identifiers through an ast
#
# Must be called from the root of the AST, which is probably a Brace
#
# @param ast rstatic language object
# @param name_resource environment mapping symbol names to resource identifiers.
#       Think of this as the evaluation environment of the code.
# @param resources environment mapping resource identifiers to the actual resource descriptions
# @ value list containing updated ast and resource.
#       ast is the original ast except that the nodes \code{x.data$resource_id} have values to look up the resources
#       resources is the orginal resource plus any new distributed resources
