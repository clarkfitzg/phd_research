    WIP: More fixes for data frames IR.
```

Does this split up sub expressions as we discussed?

Doesn't look like it.

```{R}

e = quote_blocks({
    x = rnorm(10)
    y = f(g(x, x2, h(x3)), x4, f5(x5))
}, ssa = FALSE)

e = as.data.frame(e)

```


I'm interested in identifying parallelism in for loops. This mean finding
read after write dependency, since this means they can't be parallelized.
`CodeAnalysis/explorations/loop_to_apply` has some existing work here.
Here's some examples from there:

```{R}

library(rstatic)

forloop = quote_blocks(
    for(i in seq_along(x)) {
        ans[i] = f(x[i])
    }
, ssa = FALSE)

f = as.data.frame(forloop)

# So the labels refer to the subexpressions to execute
f[1, 1][[1]]$body

f[3, 1][[1]]$read

f[3, 1][[1]]$write

```

# Data dependency

SSA should help identifying these cases.

## RAW Read After Write

Here's an example of one with true dependence, ie. not parallelizable:

```{R}
estimate = 10
for(i in 1:n) {
   estimate = update(estimate)
}
```

## WAW Write After Write

```{R}
for(i in 1:n) {
   tmp = f(i)
   ans[i] = tmp
   tmp = 20
}
```
