    WIP: More fixes for data frames IR.
```

I'm interested in identifying parallelism in for loops. This mean finding
read after write dependency, since this means they can't be parallelized.
`CodeAnalysis/explorations/loop_to_apply` has some existing work here.
Here's some examples from there:

```{R}

library(rstatic)

# quote_blocks fails
forloop = quote_ast(
    for(i in seq_along(x)) {
        ans[i] = f(x[i])
    }
)

e = quote_blocks({
    a = f(x)
    b = g(a)
    c = h(g(a), i(b))
}, ssa = FALSE)

e2 = as.data.frame(e)

to_blocks(forloop)

to_blocks(e)


```

Here's an example of one with true dependence, ie. not parallelizable:

```{R}
estimate = 10
for(i in 1:n) {
   estimate = update(estimate)
}
```
