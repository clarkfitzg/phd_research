# I can get this working incrementally by starting with the simplest things possible.
# The simplest thing is to see the system working for a completely vectorized program.

# Here's what we can do on further refinements:
# 1. column selection
# 2. force a 'collect', say with median
# 3. 'reduce' functions, as in the z score example. 


# Developing stuff that should make its way into makeParallel
