\section{Strategies}

Consider the PEMS data analysis. It's essentially a group by followed by a
map. The reduce just binds the rows of data together.

The computational strategy may differ depending on several factors.

\begin{itemize}
    \item If the data are stored in files corresponding to groups and each
        group fits in memory then I can \texttt{lapply} over the files.
    \item If we have multiple cores we can use \texttt{mclapply}.
    \item If the data doesn't fit in memory then I have to stream or map
        reduce it.
    \item If we can use command line tools to filter we can select the
        columns to read that we need.
    \item If we have a Hive cluster we can essentially let Hive do the file
        group by and column selection.
\end{itemize}
