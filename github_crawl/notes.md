Attempting to get a larger corpus of R code here.

One approach is to only look at gists for people who are conspicuous R
users.

I'm interested to see how people actually use R for data analysis work.
Packages are less interesting because they typically just contain tools.
Vignettes are interesting, and CRAN vignettes have the advantage of
requiring that the code actually works. A disadvantage is that the package
must be installed.

Jan Vitek's group has a Docker image with all the R repositories.

They also did a map of source code duplication in Github repos requiring a bunch of
downloads: http://janvitek.org/pubs/oopsla17b.pdf
Cool stuff.
