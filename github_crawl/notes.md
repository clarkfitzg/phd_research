Attempting to get a larger corpus of R code here.

One approach is to only look at gists for people who are conspicuous R
users.

I'm interested to see how people actually use R for data analysis work.
Packages are less interesting because they typically just contain tools.
Vignettes are interesting, and CRAN vignettes have the advantage of
requiring that the code actually works. A disadvantage is that the package
must be installed.
